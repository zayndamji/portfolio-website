# Use of AI
I have utilized AI to:
1) Help me understand Svelte and SvelteKit as a library
2) Help me understand errors and warnings
2) Generate various snippets of code (in +page.svelte, ProjectCard.svelte, and TypingAnimation.svelte)

I have gone through AI generated code and understood/debugged it manually.
